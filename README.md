User Authentication Login: Create a Login screen to ask users to login using an email address or a Google account. Upon successful login, navigate the user to the Reminders screen. If there is no account, the app should navigate to a Registration (Signup) screen. Signup: Create a Registration screen to allow a user to register using an email address or a Google account. Authentication: Enable the authentication using Firebase console and include Firebase UI dependency in the project. You must use this library, FirebaseUI-Android, to implement the authentication. Tip: You can use either FirebaseUserLiveData or just FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser or shared preferences. Logout: Make sure that the users can log out of the app and when the app starts again they are required to login first.
